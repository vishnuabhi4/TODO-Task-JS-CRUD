### Javascript Logic Flow
```
let form = document.getElementById("form");
```
* document: In JavaScript, the document object represents the web page or document in the browser. It provides access to the HTML content of the page.
* document.getElementById("form"): This part of the code is calling the getElementById method of the document object. The method takes a single argument, which is the id attribute value of the HTML element you want to retrieve.
* let form = ...: The result of document.getElementById("form") is assigned to a variable named form using the let keyword. This creates a new variable in the current scope.
```
form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();    // Prevent the default form submission behavior
    formValidation();       // Call the formValidation function
});
```
* `form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => { ... });` This code attaches an event listener to an HTML form element represented by the form variable. It listens for the "submit" event, which occurs when the form is submitted (e.g., when the user clicks a submit button or presses Enter inside a form field).
* `(e) => { ... };` This part defines an arrow function that serves as the event handler. The e parameter represents the event object, which contains information about the event that triggered the listener.
* `e.preventDefault();` Inside the event handler, e.preventDefault() is called. This line prevents the default behavior of form submission. By default, when a form is submitted, the browser reloads the page or navigates to a new page. Calling e.preventDefault() prevents that default behavior, allowing you to handle the form submission with custom logic.
* `formValidation();` After preventing the default behavior, the formValidation() function is called. This function is presumably defined elsewhere in your code, and its purpose is to perform validation or other actions related to the form's data.
